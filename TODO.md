# TODO / Planned Features

This document tracks planned features and improvements for SatTrack.

## 🚀 Planned Features

### 📡 Radio Operations
- [ ] **Compass mode** - Use device orientation to point at satellites (composable exists, UI integration needed)
- [ ] **Signal strength indicator** - Visual indicator based on satellite elevation
- [ ] **Enhanced Doppler display** - Show Doppler shift for all transmitters, not just selected ones
- [ ] **Frequency presets** - Save and recall common frequency presets
- [ ] **QSO logging** - Log radio contacts made through satellites

### 🛰️ Tracking Enhancements
- [ ] **Multi-satellite tracking** - Track 2-3 satellites simultaneously on polar plot
- [ ] **Satellite groups** - Organize satellites into groups (e.g., "AO-91, AO-92, SO-50")
- [ ] **Pass filtering** - Filter passes by time of day, elevation, duration
- [ ] **Pass calendar view** - Calendar view of upcoming passes

### 📊 Data & Export
- [ ] **Export path data** - Export satellite paths as KML/GPX for other apps
- [ ] **Pass history** - View past passes and their data
- [ ] **Statistics** - Track how many passes you've observed
- [ ] **Data backup/restore** - Export/import all app data

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] **Theme customization** - More theme options beyond dark mode
- [ ] **Customizable dashboard** - Rearrange widgets on home page
- [ ] **Satellite favorites** - Quick access to frequently tracked satellites
- [ ] **Quick actions** - Swipe gestures for common actions

### 🌐 Internationalization
- [ ] **Multi-language support** - Translate UI to multiple languages
- [ ] **Localized date/time formats** - Support for different regional formats

### ⚡ Performance
- [ ] **Background sync** - Update pass predictions in background
- [ ] **Optimized caching** - Better cache management for offline use
- [ ] **Lazy loading** - Load satellite data on demand

### 🧪 Testing & Quality
- [ ] **Unit tests** - Add comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] **E2E tests** - End-to-end testing for critical flows
- [ ] **Performance monitoring** - Track app performance metrics
